 * The receiver does some weird shit. Zone 5 isn't reporting requestStatus correctly - it's missing the zone bit.
 * I have no idea if that's because there aren't any speakers connected to it - or if it's just dumb.
 *
 * Also, the USB driver doesn't flush all the bytes as they come in, so getting requestStatus will probably require an
 * extra read to ensure the requested messages make it all the way through.
